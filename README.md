# GCpedia

Master branch: work in progress, mostly working upgraded to mediawiki 1.29

GCpedia branch: almost identical to current GCpedia production

Both branches include Dockerfiles to build docker images as well as docker compose files for both docker-compose and docker stack/swarm
A docker-compose file for setting up a jenkins + docker worker environment is also available.
